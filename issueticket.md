> Please note this is a very low-priority issue, if there are others I can wait. I am having trouble working with SCSS I have installed the scss package but I am having trouble getting the deisgn I found online for the horizontal line to work.
> It seems that I have to import something called compass but I am not sure if I could trust it so I just wanted wanted some recommendations on other options.

```md
1. Run `npm i node -sass`.

## Documentation

> When I try to import:

```md
SassError: File to import not found or unreadable: compass/css3.
        on line 3 of src/styles/HrDetails.scss
>> @import "compass/css3";

```
However I am hesitant to install it, just wanted some recommendations. This is compass's site: http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/
